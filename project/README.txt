Projects will be built and tested with the latest version of Visual Studio 2020.  If a specific version is required for your project, then clearly indicate that here.
-We have to maintain version 16.7.2 because of CS120. We make a game with version 16.7.2. So, you need Visual Studio Version 16.7.2.


#“How To Play” Instructions
- Before you start the game, write down your player name to record your score.
- When the game starts, the cup will begin to fill with water.
- When the water gets close to the stop line, press space key to stop.
- The score and whether you can go to the next level are determined by how close you are to the stop line.
- If the distance from the stop line is larger than 20, it is game over. Else, you can proceed.
- As the levels continue, the speed the water fills up increases after every 5 levels.
- After the game is over, the score will be saved in scoreData.txt.
- Your high score is saved in the game unless scoreData.txt is cleared.
- If you start the game with a different name, the game will understand you as a new player.
- Then the new name and its high score will be added to the text file like arcade game scoreboards.
